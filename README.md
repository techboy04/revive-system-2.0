# Techs Revive System

Techs Revive System is a template that contains a functional revive system that is highly customizable and easily implemented into your modes!

The revive system contains:
- Interact or Walk on to revive
- Fast bleed out
- Instant Respawn button (similar to what Starwatch)
- Crawling or knocked down when downed
- Downed timer or no timer
- Choice on which Teams will be affected by the system
- Additional notifiers like Communication and Big Message for when teammates are downed, revived, or down was expired
- Allowing downed players to spectate their teammates

You are allowed to use this system in your mode (feel free to let me know so I can try your mode :D) or make a more improved version, just please credit me.

I want to note, this code isnt perfect, hell this is the third and may not be the last iteration of a revive system ill ever do,  but this is the best one ive made and im super proud of it, im willing to fix bugs and make changes if possible. **If you encounter a bug, please use the Issues tab.**
